    <p>Although it seems to have a low market share in the PC market,
    it is a competitor of Windows computers in name and considering the characteristics
    of making and selling software and hardware together, and the limitations of
    a small lineup of products. Of course, the location is like that,
    and in terms of realistic figures, it lags far behind absolute supply
    and market share, both hardware and software. However, it has an unrivaled influence
    in the digital content and digital device sectors. The iPod was a huge hit, beating iRiver,
    and the iPhone had a lot of influence on the many capacitive Multi-Touch smartphones
    that will follow.On August 25, 2011, Steve Jobs stepped down as CEO and Tim Cook
    became CEO. Jobs, who took over the CEO position, died on October 6, 2011, after
    seven years of fighting pancreatic cancer. Internet users were shocked to hear of his sudden death.
    Including iPad 2, iPhone 4s after Jobs' death, iPhone 5s and iPhone 5s later,
    and plans for EarPods and AirPods are all Steve Jobs' posthumous works. Touch ID,
    which has dominated an era, is also a concept devised by Steve Jobs during his lifetime.</p>
