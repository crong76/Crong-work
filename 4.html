  <h3>new AirPods Pro 2</h3>
  <p>This is Apple's Bluetooth wireless earphone that was released on September 7,
  2022 at 10 a.mThe exterior design is almost identical to the previous one.
  There is a slight difference in the shape of the kernel type with a stem and the sensor changes.
  It is equipped with the Apple H2 chip, the successor to the previous Apple H1 chip.
  On September 8, 2022, Apple announced in the KST 02:00 event video that the active
  noise cancelling performance was up to twice the performance of its predecessor.
  In addition, a technology for selectively blocking external noise such as
  construction site noise was introduced through adaptive noise cancelling technology.
  Volume control function through swipe has been added to the force touch control of
  the existing server part, and it supports IPX 4 grade waterproofing in the same way
  as the previous one. In addition, the U1 chip is mounted to provide my search
  function through UWB, and it is possible to play the search sound through the
  internal speaker added together.</p>
